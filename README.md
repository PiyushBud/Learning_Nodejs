# To-do List fullstack webapp

Work in progress to-do list app that stores user tasks to their username.

Uses Node.js and Express to handle backend REST API requests and inflate EJS views. Additionally, a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS is used for
storage of user tasks.

## Things that need work

- Complete CRUD communications with the database
- Create better login with secure, hashed passwords
- Possibly implement sfx
